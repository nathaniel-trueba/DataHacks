    "one we assumed at first."

st.write(
    "Point Reyes is the clearest example. It is a rural coastal community in Marin County with "
    "farms and nature preserves, and its 741 kW average system size is likely agricultural or "
    "large-property solar. The same pattern shows up across the list: Paicines, Lebec, Terra Bella, "

    "This changes the interpretation of solar adoption. The permit count chart shows urban homeowners "
    "buying small systems by the thousands, while the system-size chart shows rural landowners buying "

    "From 2018 through 2022, solar adoption was essentially flat, with monthly permit counts "
    "hovering around only 100-150. Starting in early 2023, the pattern changed: permits spiked "
    "to roughly 800 in a month, which may line up with Inflation Reduction Act tax credits making "
    "solar cheaper for homeowners. By 2024 and 2025, adoption was no longer just a one-month spike; "
    "it became a sustained climb from roughly 400 to 1,400 permits per month."
)
st.write(
    "March 2026 stands out as the major anomaly, peaking at 4,592 permits. That sudden jump could "
    "reflect a policy deadline, a rush to file before incentives changed, a large data batch upload, "
    "or a genuine surge in demand. Even after April 2026 falls back to about 1,200 permits, the level "
    "is still far above the historical baseline, suggesting that the floor for solar adoption has "
    "permanently moved higher."
